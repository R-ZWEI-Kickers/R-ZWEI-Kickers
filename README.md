Hi, this is the RoboCup-SPL team @R-ZWEI-Kickers.
We're interested in computer science and electrical engineering, more precisely we're following current developments in robotics and AI.
We're working mostly using C++ for robot programming, but also incorporate some PiTorch and Python in general on the AI side of things.
If you have questions, you can reach us at rzweikickers(at)hs-kl.de
